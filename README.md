# Typst tutorial

This is the repository for my Typst tutorial on YouTube, which you can access [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3Qku9eEGkK25vbfHx_YUpvNNogYAqt3N). The script `parts1-4.typ` contains all the code discussed in parts 1 through 4. Part 5 doesn't have a script because you can simply check the vignette for the package ([Phonokit](https://github.com/guilhermegarcia/phonokit)).
